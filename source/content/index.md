## Campaign Introduction

Its been nearly 25 years since the Breaching, when the hierarchy of the Gods was shattered at the hands of mortals. For nearly a decade after the Breaching, Faerun was in a state of chaos. Tales are plenty of divinity, nature, time, and the realms unbound. Gods that walked the mortal plane for the first time in millennia. The sun and moon whirled chaotically across the sky. Weather and seasons were unmoored from the passage of time. Entire landscapes were shaped by unleashed deities and nature.

In the last few years, a tense calm has settled over the world. The great disasters of the Breaching are beginning to fade, if only on the landscape if not in the minds of the survivors. Is this a true peace, or simply the eye of the storm?

In the center of the Sword Coast the sun brightens the sky to the east, crowning the colossal Starmount Mountains in golden light before spilling over the Dessarin Valley. The land begins to wake, from the High Forest in the East to the Kryptgarden Forest in the West, and from Triboar in the north to Goldenfields in the South.

The Dessarin Valley has known its share of danger from roving bandits and raiders to giants and dragons. However, the attacks seem more common of late and rumors of cultists spread like wildfire. Most shockingly, a delegation of travelers from Mirabar have vanished on their way to Waterdeep. Its been over a month since they were last seen, and their disappearance worries groups great and small.

You find yourself in the overlooking the town of Red Larch. Whatever it is that brings you here, the Dessarin Valley is rife with opportunity for adventure, fame, and gold!
