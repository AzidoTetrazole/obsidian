Terrible Steeds  
Your PC's encounter an overgrown stone mausoleum in a small clearing, with 3 horses chained to a mossy pillar. If they inspect the mausoleum further, an absolutely whacked out wizard clearly high on something stumbles out. If someone makes a successful dc 13 persuasion check, they can offer an insultingly low price for the horses, making them have faster transport through the woods. He will most likely accept if he can even string together a sentence. On a fail, the wizard challenged you to a duel! **DM, utilize the wild magic table** After the fight is over, you find the keys to unchain the horses, but you have been bamboozled! This zonked out ninny was EXPERIMENTING on them!

**15) Tortoise Grove**  
==- In the middle of the watch shift, the ground rumbles slightly; after a few seconds, the watcher can spot a hill nearby rising, trees on its back carried aloft as the hill... stands up? A huge, reptilian head rises as well, and the immense shape of a Gargantuan tortoise begins to waddle off into the night.==  
==[DM's Note]: The tortoise is an entirely non-hostile relative species of the dragon turtle, and is simply looking for somewhere else to move for a few quick snacks (i.e. a massive swathe of the forest) before going back into a gentle, 200+ year nap. If the players try to attack it, they will discover that once it retreats into its shell (which it will do the moment any of them deal damage past its AC 57 shell) it is essentially invulnerable.==

7) A Kind Visitor
 
- While sitting and waiting for their turn to rest, the person on watch hears a noise from nearby; a single pair of boots walking through the undergrowth. A human male walks out, ducking under a tree branch before smiling to the person on watch and hailing them, albeit quietly so as not to disturb the sleepers. "Would you mind if I rest here for a while?" he asks. If asked, he'll explain that he is both lost, and weary from a long day of travelling; he openly wears the holy symbol of a local good-aligned god, and he is well-dressed. If anyone is injured, he offers to use his powers as a cleric to heal or cure them of wounds, illnesses, and even minor curses. If allowed to stay, he spends the night resting against a tree, enjoying the campfire's light, and talking with whomever is on shift as the night watchman. He leaves peaceably in the morning.
 
[DM's Note]: The visitor is actually a deva serving the god whose icon they wear. They're on a mission to find something, but it's not a particularly time-sensitive one, and they've come to enjoy the mortal realm. If asked to leave, threatened, or attacked, they will leave in peace. Additionally, his presence will scare away any threatening wildlife and other creatures, making the campsite both completely safe, and technically a holy area until they leave.
