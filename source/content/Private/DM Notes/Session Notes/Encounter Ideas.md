Terrible Steeds  
Your PC's encounter an overgrown stone mausoleum in a small clearing, with 3 horses chained to a mossy pillar. If they inspect the mausoleum further, an absolutely whacked out wizard clearly high on something stumbles out. If someone makes a successful dc 13 persuasion check, they can offer an insultingly low price for the horses, making them have faster transport through the woods. He will most likely accept if he can even string together a sentence. On a fail, the wizard challenged you to a duel! **DM, utilize the wild magic table** After the fight is over, you find the keys to unchain the horses, but you have been bamboozled! This zonked out ninny was EXPERIMENTING on them!

Always wax, yet always wane:  
I melt, succumbéd to flame.  
Lighting darkness, with fate unblessed,  
I soon devolve to shapeless mess.  
a Candle
 
Two bodies have I, though together we are one. The more I stand still the faster I run.  
A hourglass
 
What can run but never walks, has a mouth but never talks, has a head but never weeps, has a bed but never sleeps?  
A river
 
Without wings, I fly.  
Without eyes, I cry.  
What am I  
a cloud
 
"If you look at me from a certain way,  
My head you'll see, certainly.  
From another angle, you might see my tail, no doubts  
But of my body, there are no whereabouts."
