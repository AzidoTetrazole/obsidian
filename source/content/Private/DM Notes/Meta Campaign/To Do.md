    - The Priest (The Bishop)
    - Myrtlewood - Caulderon
    
    - small village with a population of around 200 people
    - Caulderon is perched at the edge of the volcano at the peak of Mount Hotenow. There is a strong smell of sulpher in the air, and motes of light gray ash float down like a gentle rain. The village is built over and around volcanic vents that seem to almost breathe, the vents sometimes drawing and sometimes exhaling hot air.
    
    Once inside the village, you'll notice the narrow, winding streets lined with small, cozy houses made of stone and wood. The houses are built close together, creating a sense of community and intimacy among the villagers. The buildings are made of rough cut stone and wood, with thatched roofs of charred wood and chimneys made of volcanic rock. The villagers wear cloaks and robes of wool or linen, dyed in earthy tones such as brown, green, and gray. They wear scarved around their necks and mouths to keep the ash out of their mouths
    
    - The inside of the buildings are shockingly different from the outside. As you step onto the raised wooden floor, instead of the muted grays and browns outside, you are greeted by brightly dyed colors and paints adorning the huts. Under the muted cloaks the villagers wear clothes made of vibrant colors and intricate embroidery
      
    
    Sarissa is the High Priestess of Equilis, succeeding Triptan after her departure from Caulderon. Equilis is the serpent who carries the sun on its head. The sister of Equilis is Samsara, who carries the moon.
     - Port Llast
    
    As you sail towards the town, you see the coastside is primarily cliffs and steep escarpments rising about 50 feet above the sea. The ship rounds a bend in the cliffs, and you see a harbor sheltered by the high rocky spit, with a fine sand beach and an inlet. A simple but sturdy set of docks extend out into the harbor. Fishing boats are pulled up on the beach, with 2 sailing ships moored on the docks.
    
      
    
    Weathered wooden buildings are built into tiers along the sea, the stone carved away from the cliffside.
    
      
    
    a small town of 700 folk mainly known for its skilled stonecutters and excellent harbor—a small bay sheltered by a high, rocky spit, with a fine beach and inlet. The port was overlooked by cliffs on which boulder-hurling siege engines were placed.
    
      
    
    The harbor was home to a twelve-boat fishing fleet, but two of the ships were in very poor repair. Port Llast's prime land-bound mercantile enterprises were quarries on the coastal headlands just south of the village.  
    The ==Cracked Anvil==: ==Haljal Throndor== was the blacksmith who ran this forge. He was quite skilled at all manner of ==ironmongery==. The establishment was easily found by the cracked anvil displayed in front of it.

Once known for her compassion and wisdom, she has become cold, calculating, and manipulative.  
Valeria is a master of deception, hiding her true intentions behind a facade of charismatic leadership. She commands unwavering loyalty from her followers, using her newfound influence to bend them to her will. She exudes an eerie calmness even in the face of adversity, a testament to the parasite's control over her.
