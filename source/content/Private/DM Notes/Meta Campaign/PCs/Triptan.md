Mother of [[Nyven]]

Triptan spent many years as the High Priestess of [[Places/Caulderon/Caulderon]], watching over the temple to Miðgarðsormr. Her daughter Nyven grew up in the relative safety of Caulderon, until that safety was pierced by the Fiend. The Fiend first took Lazuli, Nyven’s childhood friend. Through Lazuli’s influence, Nyven soon had bound herself to the Fiend.   

After Nyven’s disappearance, Triptan set out to find her daughter.

Triptan traveled with Riz's Ramblers for a short while, ultimately sacrificing herself to save Nyven and the rest of the party.
