_Weapon (any slashing or piercing simple weapon), uncommon, rare (+1), or very rare (+2)_  
This weapon is made from the harvested remains of a fallen dragon. With a properly reclaimed claw or tooth, the resource can be forged into a simple piercing or slashing weapon whose latent draconic powers can appear in battle.  
The first time you hit a creature on your turn with this weapon with an attack that you had advantage on, its draconic magic comes forth to deal an extra 1d6 damage of the original dragon’s elemental type.  
Weapons made from the claws or teeth of dragons change in rarity and power depending on the original dragon’s age. Young dragons’ bones aren’t as powerful as older ones, and create uncommon weapons. Adult dragons can produce rare weapons with a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with them, and ancient dragons can create very rare weapons that have a +2 bonus instead.

The ability to summon a bloodblade is a hemomantic process that can be learned by studying from a tome or teacher for 24 hours and a cost of 500 gp. Once you have learned the process, you can use an action to summon a bloodblade. When you summon the blade, you lose 2d6 hit points due to blood loss.
