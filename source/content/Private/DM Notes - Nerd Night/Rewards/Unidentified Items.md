Boots of Lock-kicking  
Wondrous item, Rare  
These calf length jackboots are made of soft leather and come with thick soles and a 1" heel. The bottom of each heel is stamped with an image of a keyhole. The straps are secured with silver key-shaped buckles.  
Once per day, the wearer can use the boots to kick open any locked door. The door is completely destroyed. Any creatures in a 20' line on the other side of the door take 2d4 bludgeoning damage from flying pieces of door. The destruction of the door is also accompanied by a thunderous boom and all creatures in the room on the other side of the door must make a DC15 Wisdom save to avoid being surprised.
