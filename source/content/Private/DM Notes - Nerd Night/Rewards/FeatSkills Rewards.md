Suppress Presence - Creatures with the "blindsense" special ability must make a listen or spot check (ass appropriate) vs. your stealth check to perceive you. You must have Cover to hide from blindsense.
 
Danger Sense - you may roll two dice when making your Initiative check, and take the better roll. Usable 1/day.
 
Dodge as a Bonus Action
 
Disruptive attack -  
Benefit: Through careful study you’re able to find exploitable flaws in any creature’s tactics and  
defenses. Whenever you hit a target with a melee attack you can choose to sacrifice  
your sneak attack damage in order to apply a –5 penalty to that creature’s AC for 1 round.

Precise Attack - When you deal sneak attack damage to a creature, you learn the following attributes about the target: Damage Vulnerabilities, Damage Resistances, and Damage Immunities
 
# Penetrating Shot

You send a powerful shot cleaving through your enemies.  
Prerequisites: Str 15, Point Blank Shot, base attack  
bonus +10.
 
Benefit: When you make a ranged attack with a pro-  
jectile weapon (such as a bow, crossbow, or sling), you
 
can instead choose to unleash a single, mighty attack that  
blasts through multiple opponents. This attack requires a  
standard action, and your shot takes the form of a 60-foot  
line. Make a separate attack roll against each creature in the  
line. If struck, creatures along this line take damage from  
your shot, though any extra damage (such as from a sneak  
attack or a fl aming weapon) is applied only against the fi rst  
creature struck.
 
# Flurry

You swing your weapon with uncanny speed, slicing apart a  
foe in the blink of an eye.
 
Prerequisites: Profi ciency with selected slashing weapon,
 
Weapon Focus with selected slashing weapon, Weapon Mas-  
tery (slashing), Weapon Specialization with selected slashing
 
weapon, base attack bonus +14.  
Benefi t: When you use a standard action to attack with  
any slashing weapon, you can choose to make a second attack  
with that weapon. You take a –5 penalty on the fi rst attack,  
and a –10 penalty on the second.  
When you use a full attack action with any slashing  
weapon, you gain one additional attack at your highest base  
attack bonus. That attack and all other attacks you make in  
the current round take a –5 penalty.
 
# Vexing Flanker

You excel at picking apart an opponent’s defenses when your  
allies also threaten him.  
Prerequisite: Combat Refl exes.  
Benefi t: You gain a +4 bonus on your attack rolls when  
fl anking.  
Normal: Flanking grants a +2 bonus on attack rolls.
