**Alchemist’s Crystal Phial**: _Very rare, wondrous item_. This delicate-looking crystal phial is actually quite sturdy, thanks to the magic enchanting it. The crystal that the phial is made of seems to have some sort of magical property about it that rubs off on the liquid that it contains. If one pours a couple drops of a single potion, elixir, etc., into this phial and then tops it off with water, its magic will eventually convert the water into a full phial of that sample mixture. The phial completes this task at a rate of 50gp/week, meaning it takes the phial a number of weeks to do this equal to the original mixture’s monetary value divided by 50. This property does not work with legendary potions or potions of deific importance or origin.

Plan Bee
 
Wondrous item, uncommon
 
Description:
 
When a complication arises in the midst of a heist, you must fall back on a Plan B. Sometimes, this can be quite literal. Crafted by a clever tinkerer on the criminal faction’s payroll, this little beauty has distracted the city guards for years.
 
As an action, you can activate this mechanical bee and command it to fly up to 60 feet. When it finishes moving, it emits a loud buzzing whir and each creature within 30 feet of it that can hear it must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. A creature that fails this save is distracted by the bee for 1 minute. A distracted creature has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and attack rolls, and can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save. After a minute has passed, the bee becomes a mundane mechanical toy.
 
Very rare variant. The DC becomes 15 instead of 13. Additionally, the bee does not become a mechanical toy once it has been used, and can instead be used again after the next dawn.
   

Patron's Gift
 
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a warlock)*
 
These medallions vary in design, magically changing to match the aesthetic of your particular patron. If you hold the medallion to your bare chest for 1 minute it melds to your body and latches on. Once secured the medallion cannot be removed unless you renounce your patron and unattune.
 
While the medallion is secured to your chest, you can use an action on your turn to instantly gain all the benefits of a short rest. This surge of power is visible and violent. You must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure you fall prone and lose concentration on any spell you are attempting to maintain.
 
Once you use the medallion in this way, you gain no benefit from your next short rest and you must complete a long rest before you can use it in this way again.
 
**Chain Shirt of the Forgotten**  
_Armor (Chain Shirt), uncommon (requires attunement)_  
==The bearer may spend an action to attempt to ignite the old magic in this armor with a DC 13 Charisma check. If successful, treat this as a +1 armor as long as the bearer maintains concentration on this effect, maximum 10 minutes.==

Allow 90 ft. of flight for 1 round  
Opportunity Attacks against the wearer are made with disadvantage during this round  
Deals 2d8 points of lightning damage to those the wearer passes

**Amulet of the Lycanthrope**  
**Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)**
 
This rounded amulet depicts a harrowing crescent moon with blood-red claw marks running through its center. The markings emit a dim red light on the day of a full moon.
 
If you're not a lycanthrope, you can use a bonus action while wearing the amulet to assume a more bestial appearance, taking on the claws and defining features of either a rat, tiger, or wolf (your choice). This transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you drop to 0 hit points or use a bonus action to revert to your normal form. For the duration, you can use your claws as natural weapons when making unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d8 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. In addition, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell for the duration of the transformation. This property can't be used again for 12 hours or until the next dusk, whichever comes first. Alternatively, if it's within 24 hours of a full moon, this property can be used again after 6 hours, instead of 12.
 
If you're already a lycanthrope and are wearing the amulet, your claw and bite attacks while in your animal or hybrid forms deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage and count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. In addition, your bite attack save DC increases by 3.
 
Curse. This amulet is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you have disadvantage on saving throws made to resist becoming cursed by lycanthropy.

Phoenix Fan  
Wondrous item, rare
 
This vibrant paper fan bears a gilded phoenix design and 5 fire opals along its wooden clasp. The fan has 5 charges and regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the fan, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 15, spell attack bonus +7): fire shield (4 charges), fog cloud (1 charge; the cloud is made of smoke), scorching ray (2 charges), or wall of fire (4 charges). Alternatively, you can use a reaction when you or a creature within 60 feet of you falls to expend 1 of the fan's charges to cast the feather fall spell on up to five falling creatures within range.
 
You can cast these spells from the fan even if it doesn't have enough charges. When you do, there is a cumulative 20% chance that the fan is destroyed for each spent charge beyond the number of remaining charges in the fan. If the fan is destroyed in this way, the spell fails and the action to cast it is wasted, and the fan is consumed by flame as it turns to dust and is destroyed.

Bracelet of the Shattered Aegis  
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)
 
While wearing the bracelet, you can expend 1 of its charges as a reaction when a friendly creature that you can see within 15 feet of you takes damage from an attack. That creature gains a bonus to its AC equal to your spellcasting ability modifier until the start of your next turn, including against the triggering attack (potentially causing it to miss), as a shimmering, magical barrier protects it from harm. If the creature is already under the effect of the shield spell, this property has no effect, and the charge is wasted. If an attacker hits the creature while it's protected by this barrier, the barrier shatters, and any hostile creature within 5 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d8 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful one. When the barrier shatters, the creature loses this bonus to its AC.

Cube of Satiation  
Wondrous, rare, attunement required The cube is 8 inches on each side and inlaid with runes and moving/sliding parts
 
Spending at least 2 hours with the box while attuned let’s the user attempt to solve it. Every 24 hours the colors and patterns change. After successfully rolling 3 straight intelligence checks DC 18. Successfully solving gives all characters within 20 feet a level. Context: my campaign goes by milestone and my party kept overland traveling for no reason, getting in many encounters then complaining about not leveling up. They know the statistical improbability, but it keeps them off my back.

Shield of the Everfighter  
Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement)
 
This heater shield's center is made of plated sheets of armor. While holding it, you can use a bonus action to speak the shield's command word to cause it to magically collapse and reshape itself into a metal-plated bracer on your arm. While in bracer form, the shield provides no benefit to your AC but leaves your hand free. Speaking the command word again as a bonus action or removing the bracer causes it to become a shield again.
 
Alternatively, you can return the bracer to its shield form as a reaction when you're hit by an attack, dropping anything held in that hand and increasing your AC as normal: potentially causing the triggering attack to miss you.
 
In addition, if you're a fighter, you gain 1d10 temporary hit points when you use either your Action Surge or Second Wind class feature. If you are also holding the gladius of the everfighter, you can transform the shield as part of the same action or bonus action used to transform the weapon.
