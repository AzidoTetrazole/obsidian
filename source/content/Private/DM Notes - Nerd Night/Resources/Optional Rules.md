Shields  
If you wanted to use a shield, you could:
 
Use a small shield for 1ac, but the ability to carry stuff in the hand(but not weapons).
 
Use a buckler for 1ac, but with the ability to use a bow or crossbow without issue, and offhand weapons at a hit penalty.
 
Use a normal(large) shield for 2ac without being able to carry stuff, but with the option to shield bash. And you could buy shield spikes to up this damage.
 
Use a tower shield which can act as any sort of cover depending on how much you want to hide behind it.
