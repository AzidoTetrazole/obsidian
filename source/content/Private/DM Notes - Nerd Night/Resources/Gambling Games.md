Liar’s Dice (Min 10 gp buy-in).** A player rolls 5d6 and keeps their roll secret. Each player takes turns bidding a face value and a number equal to the number of dice showing said face value amongst all player’s dice. A player has two choices during their turn: make a higher bid or challenge the previous player’s bid. Raising the bid means either increasing the quantity, or the face value, or both. If a bid is challenged, all dice are revealed. If the bid is true, the bidder wins and the challenger is eliminated. If the bid is false, the challenger wins and the bidder is eliminated.

If neither occurs, a player loses if their total is less than the dealer’s, and wins if their total is greater than the dealer’s. Payout for winning players is 3:2. If both the dealer and a player score a 21, that player wins their bet back 1:1.
