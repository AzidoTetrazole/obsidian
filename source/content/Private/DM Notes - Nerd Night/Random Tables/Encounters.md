Think Legend of Zelda's chickens, but with ducks.  
Start with as many ducks as there are players and add 1d4 ducks.  
Each round, add 1d4 flying ducks and 1d6 waddling ducks.  
Just to mess with your players, after the third round add in a single duck that stands away from the combat and just watches. Make him look different. They might get the impression that if they kill that duck, the nightmare ends.  
It doesn't.  
If that duck dies, it releases a necromantic wave of energy that revives all slain ducks as zombie ducks. Continue to add ducks as described above.  
Beginning the second round after the "special" duck is slain, have him return to life and do the same, just watching and not engaging. If the players go two rounds without harming the Duckromancer, stop producing more ducks. The party has to leave the area without killing that duck to avoid further Duckpocalypse.  
Randomly, have the Duckromancer show up in odd places throughout the campaign. Your players may even want to capture the duck and kill him later when the ensuing Duckpocalypse is a benefit, because the ducks attack everyone.
