Fixing Shalpask-  
OOH OR like an Indiana Jones type snake temple, where the serpent chooses its bearer and then changes into the staff upon choosing? More booby traps and guardians to defeat that way!!  
I'm warming to the snake temple idea-and the temple could be in her home mountain range?  
It could be the temple of her god! The sun serpent!  
From our one shot!
 
Ooh also another idea- what if the bishop just happens to meet us there? After all Parias has been there before, but I don't know about a reason he would be there. I just think it would be fucking hilarious for Parias and Triptan to meet again and Njal be like YoU KnOw ThE BiShOp?!?

The medusa, named Ava, was once a powerful sorceress who lived in a small village at the base of the volcano. She was feared and respected for her magical abilities, which included the power to turn people to stone with her gaze.
 
Ava became obsessed with the snake temple, which was said to contain ancient relics and powerful magical artifacts. She believed that if she could gain control of the temple, she would be able to harness its power and become even more feared and respected.
 
To that end, Ava began studying the ancient texts and rituals of the snake temple, hoping to find a way to gain access to its inner sanctum. She also cultivated relationships with the snakes that lived in the temple, learning their language and customs.
 
One day, Ava learned of a prophecy that said that a medusa would one day take over the snake temple and bring about a new era of prosperity and peace. Believing that she was destined to fulfill this prophecy, Ava set out to seize control of the temple.
 
She used her charm and cunning to win over the snakes and convince them that she was the one they had been waiting for. She also used her magic to defeat or turn to stone any who opposed her.
 
Eventually, Ava succeeded in taking over the snake temple and establishing herself as its ruler. From her perch at the top of the volcano, she ruled with an iron fist, using her magical powers to keep the snakes in line and keep the villagers in fear.
 
Many feared and hated Ava, but others saw her as a visionary leader who would bring about a new era of prosperity and peace. Regardless, all knew that Ava was not to be crossed, for she was a medusa, with the power to turn anyone to stone with her gaze.
