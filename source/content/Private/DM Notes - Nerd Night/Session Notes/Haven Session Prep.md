Gentleman's door - I found this somewhere else but it is still a neat concept. The Gentlemen’s DoorA doorframe with a ‘reflection’ of the door user blocking the way. You can clearly see what is behind the door, but no matter what you do, your reflection will mimic your actions and block the way.To get passed the door, you must step to the side and say “after you!” Or some other reasonably polite thing. The reflection will say “no no please I insist!” And will step to the side and motion for you to enter. Upon passing the door, your ‘reflection’ vanishes.

- Anything that removes reflection
 
It might not be Dungeons and Dragons, but a buddy of mine ran a Star Wars Saga Edition game not too long ago, and put his party in a room with the doors closing on either end. The door on the far side, towards their destination, had a panel with a button and a display. The display had a timer for 30 seconds, and everytime the button was pressed, the timer reset and two droids fell from the ceiling to attack. From his recounting of the session, he said his party pressed the button eight times, and were near death, before allowing the timer to expire to see what happens. When the timer hit zero, the doors opened. Needless to say, his party was upset, but to me, that sounds hilarious.
 
There was a 15' moat surrounding a pyramid. There are multiple 12' planks on both sides of the moat which won't reach across by themselves.  
You have to lay a plank across a corner (◺) then set another plank from the right angle corner to the cross-piece and have several party members stand on it. Then carefully lay another plank to the other side.  
Cross one at a time, then you have to anchor the pyramid side for the last two party members cross the moat.
 
The pyramid had a magical eye which would shoot scorching rays at flying or levitating persons.
 
EDIT: Added proper lengths and explanation.
