## DM Notes
From what I think Trevor and I have agreed, we’re monkey shifters, an ancestor of ours made a ****fae contract**** by giving the fae our real family name which cursed our whole family line but we just roll with it now because it be what it be. Tiny and Meany go predominantly by nicknames just in case. Tiny’s real name is Rosalia.
- Random table for if they speak their names?
Her parents sent her away to the ****Zephyr’s Ascent Monastery**** to be trained to fight but also be a “real lady” who would marry up in the world.

- Tiny's parents gave her to the Zephyr's Ascent Monastery, with the Cult of Howling Wind promising that the curse would be broken by their leader.
- What has been the curses effects?

Meany doesn’t know the true purpose of the monastery/school is to train marriageable assassins, he just thought it was a boarding school. ****Matron Espetha****, who ruled the monastery with an iron hand, hates Tiny’s attitude and dancing. Tiny has absolutely 0 interest in being married or an assassin she literally just wants to dance, explore, have fun, and live life to the fullest and be her happiest thriving self.

The Zephyr’s Ascent Monastery has ulterior motives, they hide behind being hermits and not bothered by earthly cares. They are devoted to a figure they call the ****Shadow of the Four Winds.**** The young women they raise and teach are supposed to be placed in positions of influence and power. And kill and replace a high ruling lady if need be. Hence why they’re assassins as well as monks.

Tiny had a roommate, an elf named ****Sivene****. They hated each other at first but then one night Sivene followed Tiny to the little courtyard she was hiding in and watched her dance and INSISTED she teach her too. So the Sivene and Tiny became good friends, spending many nights sparring and dancing.

Tiny would have been around when the monks of the Zephyr's Ascent hosted pilgrims who were going to re-establish a new monastery in the Dessarin Valley, the ****Sacred Stone Monastery****. You were kept away from the pilgrims as much as possible, but it seemed like they were grudging allies of the monks of the Zephyrs Ascent. They were greeted and given shelter warmly enough, but you heard arguing and raised voices before the pilgrims ultimately departed. Tiny overheard the monks talking about clearing an old keep in the Sumber Hills and establishing the Monastery.

When Tiny was listening to the Stone Temple Monks discuss the old keep they would recover, one of them mentioned the name of a dwarven stronghold.  You are shocked to hear this name, as it is very familiar to you. You remember the ancient map that your grandfather would show you, gingerly unrolling the ancient vellum. Much of the map is faded, leaving fewer landmarks to make the location clear. One area is still quite clear, despite the age of the map. The name of the location on the map, and the name that Tiny hears whispered between the monks... ****Tyar-Besil.****

When you contact Meanie to break you out, you insist he brings the old map with him.

The head nun (Matron Espetha) found Tiny dancing hidden away at night, and then combining dancing and fighting styles (****capoeira**** Brazilian martial arts combining dance and acrobatics) and decided that was decidedly too happy and unladylike and not in line with the monastic goals. Sivene was never caught because she was at a long political dinner the night Tiny was caught!

I have considered the idea that Tiny gets abused/punitive measures put on her but I’m not set on that idea but not unhappy to just imply that.

Tiny gets word to Meany to GET HER THE HECK OUT and he comes bust her out and they go traveling together because they both want to live life and have their adventures and see what the world has to offer!

Tiny is a happy, girly, pink and sparkly and gold jewelry wearing dancing monk who’s here for a good time and positive vibes. We don’t talk about the parents, we’re not hiding them we just don’t bring them up at least for Tiny because they’re not relevant to her goals of “for the lolz with my twin.”
