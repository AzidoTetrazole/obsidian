## DM Notes
One half of The Either/The Or, twin brother to Cordelia. The son of Njal and Lapis, 20 years old, born shortly after his parents returned to Eriksvagr upon their return home in the aftermath of the Breaching. Raised surrounded by the culture of his father’s people, with the expectation that he would be a warrior, as is expected from men of his culture - let alone royalty. Despite the expectations, he often felt like something of an outsider; in personality and interests he has more in common with his mother, Lapis, from whom he inherited his silver eyes. From his father he inherited his black hair and his size; while not being as large as his father, Konrad stands out in a crowd in the southern continent of Faerun.

****Prologue:****

Having grown up constantly hearing their parents' stories of their adventures in their youth, both Konrad and Cordelia developed a certain wanderlust. Well, at least Cordelia did. Her brother on the other hand, tended towards following where his sister’s heart led them (You’re welcome to change, this just brainstorming here). Oftentimes they accompanied trusted individuals to their parents on trips to settle squabbles between jarls or even to fend off bandits. However, as they came into their young adulthood, their father started to become increasingly concerned after countless years of attempting to locate their grandfather. From the stories, they knew that their Mother had attempted repeatedly to locate him via magical means, but every time she got close to making contact, she got the overwhelming sense that Parias wouldn’t be found until he wanted to be found.
