## DM Notes
- Who is the unicorn the servant of?
Leon Topithecus. Twin Brother to Rosalia "Tiny". Meany and Tiny grew up in (Iraebar (Overland City/City of A Thousand Spires) with their grandfather (Papio), and their parents Pongo (Father) and Diana (Mother). Their parents run a small shop out of their home, where they sell what goods they are able to find or make.

Since their first days, Meany and Tiny knew of their family curse. An ancestor gave away their family name to the fae, and the family has had misfortunes ever since. Their parents warned them to never speak their last name, as it could call down additional trouble. Meany and Tiny were encouraged to not draw attention to themselves, or take any great risk, lest the fae curse find them again.

Being twins they've done most everything together. Tiny was born first with Meany just a few minutes behind her and since she is older, Meany has sort of looked up to her, for better or worse. Which has usually been for worse as she has had a knack for getting them into trouble. Tiny has a way of getting them into trouble, but she isn't fully at fault as Meany tend to agree with her ideas and sometimes add some extra flavor to it. Whatever happens Meany always has Tiny's back whether it be to talk their way out of trouble, fight beside her, or in the rare instance run. As kids when they got into trouble with their parents, Meany always took the blame and,Â  if there was any, the punishment.  
  
The only time they were ever separated as kids was when Tiny when to classes/training. Meany was never into sports or anything athletic and failed out early. When she went to training Meany learned to do his own thing. He started in town, but quickly learned he wasn't made for the streets as he was too weak without Tiny. He then made his way to the library and found an interest in plants. It started small with "don't eat this berry or this mushroom" and turned into a love of plants and how they can effect the people and world around. From house plant growth, to these plants can help with scars, to this plant can cure X disease. He then experimented with plants in the garden and then plants in the house. He was made fun of but if someone said something, Tiny made the first move. He strives to know every plant and everything about them from water, light, soil to what they can be used for and combined with for different effects, with healing and health being the forefront.  
  
Meany hasn't always been magically inclined, but the twins have always had good souls and help others out when they can. In one instance there was a flood and while others fled to higher ground, the twins stayed back to help animals that were not able to make it out. During this a dog was stuck and sure to drown and by the time we got it out it was dead. Trying to revive it, Meany looked up and saw a Unicorn who telepathically communicated with him offering abilities to heal this animal and others, in return for following some decisions he would later be told.  
That is at least the story that Tiny knows. In reality while trying to save this dog, Tiny also got stuck under rubble and by the time Meany got her out she was dead. He did make the deal with a Unicorn, but it was to save Tiny's life. Meany with never tell Tiny the truth of his deal, that she is the reason. Mostly because he thinks she will hold it over him and go out of her way to help him. That won't work for Meany because he's the one who always helps.  
  
The celestial the unicorn serves is unknown to Meany, but he believes it is either Lathander, Selune, or Torm though that's just his thoughts. (Ultimately I will leave this option open to the DM to choose). The Unicorn he saw had Golden, Metalic

Sometimes Meany has seen the Unicorn off in the distance, keeping out of sight to most. It telepathically speaks to him and has shown him flashes of images - too quickly for Meany to understand, but the feeling during these is that nature is out of balance. Terrible disaster is drawing closer with every passing day. He has had these nightmares as well. Flashes too quick to understand, but that foreboding feeling of a pressing terror.

- __Visions:__ maelstroms of fire, forests turned to ash in an instant, towers of buildings collapsing into the earth, tidal waves destroying entire coastlines, tornados
- __Worst of all: Waking in a blank void, unable to see, speak, or scream as a shadow beyond all darkness reaches towards him.__

A couple months ago, Papio (grandfather) died. He was an old adventurer and liked to tell tales of his exploits to Tiny and Meanie.

Recently, Tiny was sent to another training by their parents. Strangely, they seemed extra happy when she was gone. They had whispered conversations about how their lives were "... soon going back to the way they were supposed to be."

Soon after, Meanie received a message from Tiny. Her new training wasn't going well, and she needed to leave quickly. Strangely, she insisted that Meanie bring an ancient vellum map that Grandfather had loved to show them.
