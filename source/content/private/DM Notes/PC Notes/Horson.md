## DM Notes

Horson is a Halfling Drow Bard that was born in ****Phandalin****.  He is the bastard child of ****Riz**** and a local Halfling prostitute.  He never met Riz or his mother, as she dropped him off at an orphanage after his birth and left town.  The people at the orphanage told Horson vague details about his parents and he does not know their names.  He simply knows that his father was a Drow Elf adventurer that came through town on the way to ****Axeholm**** and his mother gave him up to the orphanage prior to leaving town.

- How does his parentage come up later?

Horson grew up poor and quickly learned to ingratiate himself with people who could provide some modicum of safety.  He joined a gang of other teenagers who would run small cons on locals.  This group moved around frequently, as staying in one place too long would attract attention to their schemes.  While they never made a lot of money, they made enough to survive.  Horson became the mouthpiece of the group, as he was able to sweet talk people with relative ease.  This was especially impressive since many locals were somewhat wary of Drows, but his diminutive stature often negated their fear of him.

While in Amphail, he began a relationship with the daughter of a local Lord.  This relationship was a simple fling that Horson began largely as a dare from other gang members to bed the daughter of the hated Lord.  The Lord did not approve of Horson and directed his police to surveil Horson and discover the location of the gang’s hideout. 

Horson was out celebrating the success of a con with the Lord's daughter when the police raided their hideout and arrested all members of the gang.  Upon returning to the hideout, he saw guards surrounding the place and knew that he had to leave town.  He snuck out under the cover of darkness and joined up with a group of travelers that were heading to the town where the campaign begins.

- The last con was stealing money from a mercenary of Rivergard Keep, disguised as a traveling merchant. It was Jolliver Grimjaw who tipped off the lord of Amphail to Horson's gang.

Horson understands the importance of belonging to a party but also understands the fleeting nature of these relationships.  He is loyal to the point of convenience but can drop and run at any moment.  He does not believe that he would purposely betray party members but does not adhere to a specific code of ethics.  He is not a great fighter and will try to deescalate any situation to avoid violence.  His main concern is survival and he does not have any great ambitions beyond this.
