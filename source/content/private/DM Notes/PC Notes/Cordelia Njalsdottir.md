## DM Notes
The older twin to her brother Konrad, Cordelia inherited her father’s pale complexion and blue eyes, but her mother's long and wavy powder blue hair. Oftentimes, people mistook it as dyed from crushed up flowers, but if one looked closely, it would look damp for no reason. And if seen up close, her freckles were the hue of the most indistinguishable purple-like those of her mother. 

She was raised under the same expectation that to lead was to become a warrior capable of protecting herself, but more importantly, her people. She spent many nights on guard duty, as well as accompanying the hunting parties as they ranged the North in search of game. Having inherited her mother’s affinity for the arcane, on these escapades, she tended to spend more time in animal forms than her human one. Sometimes, she flew the skies as small, undetectable fowl, while others she took the form of native beasts that blended in with the surroundings.

****Prologue:****

Having grown up constantly hearing their parents' stories of their adventures in their youth, both Konrad and Cordelia developed a certain wanderlust. Well, at least Cordelia did. Her brother on the other hand, tended towards following where his sister’s heart led them (You’re welcome to change, this just brainstorming here). Oftentimes they accompanied trusted individuals to their parents on trips to settle squabbles between jarls or even to fend off bandits. However, as they came into their young adulthood, their father started to become increasingly concerned after countless years of attempting to locate their grandfather. From the stories, they knew that their Mother had attempted repeatedly to locate him via magical means, but every time she got close to making contact, she got the overwhelming sense that Parias wouldn’t be found until he wanted to be found.
