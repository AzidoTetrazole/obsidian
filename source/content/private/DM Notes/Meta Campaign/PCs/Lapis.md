- Cleric of Oghma(?) - The Binder of What is Known
    
    - inspiration, invention, and knowledge
    - The Binder of What is Known, or simply the Binder, was also a member of the Celtic pantheon as a neutral or neutral good intermediate deity of speech and writing
    - Oghma's avatar most often appeared as a handsome, dark-skinned man in bright, resplendent, and stylish clothes[8][9] and ornate armor more appropriate to a fantastic stage play than anywhere else.
    - it was Oghma's burden to choose which ideas and thoughts would spread and which would fade away with their creator, so that all others would not be in jeopardy. Resting heavily in his heart were the experiences of millennia and hence in this duty he was serious, firmly protective, and deeply cautious.[3][8][9][10][11][12] He favored a doctrine of ideological conservatism and sticking strictly to the status quo, rather than risking a rogue idea disrupting the delicate balance of knowledge he had been preserving since history began.
