    - **Hut in the woods -**

Your group of adventurers has been approached by a local shopkeeper Diedre. She has hired you to investigate a mysterious hut in the woods. She explains that when she was a child she and a group of friends discovered the hut. A old crone invited the children inside for treats, but Diedre was too afraid. Her friends went inside the hut, but never came out. Dierdre peeked in the windows, but the children were gone. She ran to get help, but when she returned the hut was nowhere to be seen!
 
Yesterday as she was searching for herbs she stumbled across the hut, and saw the same old crone from her childhood! She will pay each of you 50 gp to investigate the hut and bring her any information on her friends and their fate.

- **Low Level monsters find uber powerful magic items**

Had a very silly one-shot as goblins finding a dead archmage's treasure vault. Had a ring of wishes in it. When we went outside into bright light, and the person wearing the ring said "I wish it wasn't so bright outside" and the sun abruptly dimmed, lol!
 
The party of monsters are gathered in a dark dank cave, when a large commotion sounds at the center of the complex. As the party arrives in the cavern, they find evidence of a massacre. Dozens of your montrous companions lay slain in various states of dismemberment and destruction. Most shockingly, you see a party of 4 adventurers dead, surrounding your mistress! She is severely hurt, breathing her last conscious breath, as she softly cackles "â€¦ my defeat is temporary, but my control over the monsters of this cavern will fade as well. Defend yourselves if you can! Those who survive will be my chosen few upon my return!"
