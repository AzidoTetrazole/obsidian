- Game Setting - Forgotten Realms - The game I plan to run
    
    - Close to rules as written, with some homebrew
    - Rule of Cool
    - Not out to kill anyone, but the game will be a challenge to the characters
    - Maps/Minis & Theatre of the mind - Social Contract
    
    - Everyone (GM and players) are here to have fun.
        
        - I will run a game that is fun, fair, and tailored for them. I will allow every player to contribute to the ongoing story and give every character moments to shine.
        - Players will respect and listen to one another, respect and listen to the DM.
        - Know your characters and abilities, as best as possible.
        - I will assist and arbitrate the rules when possible/needed.
        - We play DND with a critical mass of players. Absent players "fade-out"
        - We start on time to give ourselves as much play time as possible.
    - Secrets and metagaming
        
        - Some items can be kept secret (elements of your backstory etc)
        - Actions taken during the game will be announced at the table, and may involve a roll
    - Player Comfort
        
        - Rated R for Violence
        - Rated PG-13 for most everything else
    - Player Agency
        
        - You are your character. In general, I won't tell you what your character does or feels.
        - What background you share with me may be pulled into a character arc/story.
