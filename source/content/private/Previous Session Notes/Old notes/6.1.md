Umbrage hill:
 
The body appears like a large feline, similar to a lion. As you look closer, not only is it much larger than a lion, but has a brilliant hue of red . You see the creature has rows of spikes around the head, neck and spine, all the way down its long tail, where it ends in a cluster of the sharp spines. Atop its back is a pair of scarlet leathery wings.
