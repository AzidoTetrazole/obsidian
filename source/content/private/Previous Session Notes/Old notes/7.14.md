Party is at edge of a crevasse in the Mere of Dead Men
 
They head around the side of the crevasse:

- Travel through blackened brambles
- Trapped dryad - they avoided
    
    - Palus - woman covered in scrapes and scratches. Hair is a dull red color, with patches of black tar
- Ruins of a tower and surrounding courtyard.
    
    - Blackened tree in the center
    - Stone base torn and pushed aside by the tree
    - Stream flowing from underneath
    - Both tree and stream flowing heavily with the black tar
    - Rot Troll chewing on a corpse in the middle of the field
    - A zombie drops right next to the party
