# Description
Caulderon is perched at the edge of the volcano at the peak of Mount Hotenow. The hometown of [[Triptan]], [[Nyven]], and [[People/Lazuli]], Caulderon is home to the Temple of the Miðgarðsormr.   

There is a strong smell of sulfur in the air, and motes of light gray ash float down like a gentle rain. The village is built over and around volcanic vents that seem to almost breathe, the vents sometimes drawing and sometimes exhaling hot air.   Once inside the village, you'll notice the narrow, winding streets lined with small, cozy houses made of stone and wood. The houses are built close together, creating a sense of community and intimacy among the villagers. The buildings are made of rough cut stone and wood, with thatched roofs of charred wood and chimneys made of volcanic rock. The villagers wear cloaks and robes of wool or linen, dyed in earthy tones such as brown, green, and gray. They wear scarves around their necks and mouths to keep the ash out of their mouths   The inside of the buildings are shockingly different from the outside. As you step onto the raised wooden floor, instead of the muted grays and browns outside, you are greeted by brightly dyed colors and paints adorning the huts. Under the muted cloaks the villagers wear clothes made of vibrant colors and intricate embroidery
