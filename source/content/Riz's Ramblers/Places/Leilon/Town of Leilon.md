# Description
Leilon is a small mining town that serves as a convenient resting place for weary travelers on the High Road along the Sword Coast between Neverwinter and Waterdeep.

A key trading port, Leilon has had its challenges. Nearly destroyed during the Spellplague, it has started to be rebuilt by the direction of Lord Dagult Neverember.

Most recently the town was nearly overrun by two armies following the gods of Myrkul and Talos, only to be rebuffed by the gathered allies of the own, and the Ramblers adventuring party.
