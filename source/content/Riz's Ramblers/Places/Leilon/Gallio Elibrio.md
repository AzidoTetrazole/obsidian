A member of the [[Cloak of Many Stars]]
Subordinate of [[People/Simihr Biwyll|Simihr Biwyll]]
Former keeper of the [[House of Thalivar]] in the center of [[Town of Leilon|Town of Leilon]]

A brooding middle-aged male Rashemi human mage. He came to Neverwinter to find and unlock the secrets of the House of Thalivar and found many coded journals in the ruin, which he has set about decoding with slow progress. Gallio is studying in the House of Thallivar, a semi-ruined tower in the center of Leilon. He has been studying planar mechanics, with a focus on the Spellplague. During the Ramblers attempt to investigate ghostly happenings at the tower, they caused great damage to the journals he was studying.

His superior Simihr recommended having the Ramblers travel through the rebuilt Planar Beacon. Gallio reluctantly agreed, travelling along invisibly. He wanted to collect the [[Ruinstone]], but failed due to the Ramblers. Gallio returned to the Cloak's home in disgrace.
