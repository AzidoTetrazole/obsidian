# Profile
Father of [[Njal Stormbringer Ragnarsson]]

His honor stripped due to Njal's disobediance, he was sent by [[Jarl Harald]] to retrieve the Stone of Heroes, actually the Horn of Karshimis. He was captured by Lalroch, lost his left arm to frostbite, and survived by force of will alone.

After the dethroning of [[Jarl Harald]], Ragnar has been a close advisor to the new Jarl, [[Astrid Jarlsdotter]]
