#### Description & History
A small town mainly known for its skilled stonecutters and excellent harborâ€”a small bay sheltered by a high, rocky spit, with a fine beach and inlet. It was here that Rizlyn, Barakus Enigma, and Thelid first met. The First Captain ([[Haermos Dothwintyl]]) has been single-minded in building a militia to defend Port Last. Whether the soldiers are slaves or prisoners, he has no qualms about leaving them no choice but to join. 

The town has been recently cleared of a mind-flayer infestation, lead by a converted Haermos.
