## Profile
Founding member of [[The Ramblers]]
Daughter of [[Triptan of Caulderon]]
Business partner of [[Barakus Enigma]] in [[TT's Tower]]
Childhood friend of [[Lazuli of Caulderon]]

Raised in the volcanic town of [[Village of Caulderon]], Nyven grew up under the watchful eye of her mother [[Triptan of Caulderon]]. Her childhood best friend was [[People/Lazuli]]. 

When Lazuli fell under the sway of [[Koraboros]], Nyven too was drawn into a pact with the pit fiend.

As part of the Ramblers, she chose to sacrifice herself to save [[Barakus Enigma]] when he was in mortal danger, placing herself under the complete control of Koraboros. The Ramblers fought to free Nyven from his clutches, but only succeeded after the sacrifice of Triptan.
