| Parents left to serve [[Xemnus]], and never returned - Colt believes the church can tell him where they are.<br>   <br><br>So my character believes that he is the only one with the power of he's church when in reality there are others the church keeps them separated. The church is public but the missions that they send colt on is secret with only the heads of the churches and heads of local branches knowing who colt is the church is called the followers of life. They see blood as the most precious form of proof of life. They hold sermons preaching the protection of blood and how it flows through all and believes that only the purest of blood can ascend and blood can be cleansed through actions. On the back end they use blood rituals that sacrifice blood to their god Xemnus (Zem-Nus) when there are no depictions of him they speculate he is pure through and through<br><br>Xemnus - True name of Red Knight (deity of strategy and battle tactics) -  <br>wears crimson red cloak plate mail with a full helm, their eyes gleaming like ruby stars. |

- Deity of strategy and battle tactics
- Blood is our symbol of life, of the hope for the future, of the purpose of struggle while it flows.
- Followers of Life are tasked with guiding leaders and powers through influence.
- Rooks are the shadow agents, doing the work that the Followers can't publicly claim.
- Bishops (the Priest) guide rooks, knights, & pawns

- The Followers of Life are an association of priests, clerics, and paladins. The Followers are sworn to Xemnus, a mysterious celestial deity. The Followers rites are centered on blood, which to them symbolizes the proof of life, sacrifice, cleansing, and the connection between the living.
- The Followers have a particular hate for necromancy and undeath, as it is the antitheses of their beliefs.
- Xemnus isn't widely worshipped, but his followers are often found in the temples of the Triad (some of the most powerful gods):
    
    - Tyr (Law/Justice) - Symbol: Scales atop a warhammer
    - Ilmater (Endurance/Martyrdom) - Symbol: Hands bound in blood red cord
    - Torm (Duty/loyalty) - Symbol: Palm of an armored gauntlet
- The Followers of Life harnessed the natural power in Colt through an oath to Xemnus, and taught him blood rites to enhance that power. Colt has been called to any number of tasks by the Followers, both mundane and fantastic. Whether destroying shipments of grain, delivering packages or messages, or using his abilities to destroy monsters, the Followers have required absolute dedication and shared none of their strategy or overall goals with Colt.

Modify Memory - his memory of the fight in the Temple was changed to show that the Ramblers killed his priest contact out of cold blood.

High ones- I am headed to Port Llast in the morning, can give an update on the unresponsive branch within the next couple weeks.
 
Greetings high ones, I have an update on my journey I have reached portlas and have found out that the churches blood was impure and has been dealt with . they had the blood of monsters running through them this group I have found has helped me more times over than I can count on my endeavor. Currently we are on the trail of the church of the storms that is attacking recklessly. I ask for your assistance in tracking the church of storms before they cause more problems.
