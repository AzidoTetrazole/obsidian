![[Thelid.jpg|500]]
Member of [[The Ramblers]]
Longtime friend of [[Ariadne Vosamo]]
Shaman of [[Platanism]]
Free Lord of [[Port Llast]]

Thelid was held captive in Port Llast, and forced to be a warrior for the leader of the city. After escaping (with help from [[Barakus]] and [[Riz's Ramblers/Player Characters/Rizlyn|Rizlyn]]), he accompanied his friend Ariadne to a farm near [[Phandolin]]. After Rizlyn's death, Thelid joined the Ramblers.

As a member of the Ramblers, Thelid successfully defeated an incursion of mind flayers trying to make a foothold on the material plane in Port Llast. For his heroism, he was named a Free Lord.

Thelid fell in battle against a giant abomination. However, his name was written in the remaining dust from the [[Orb of Fate]], leaving his ultimate fate unknown.
