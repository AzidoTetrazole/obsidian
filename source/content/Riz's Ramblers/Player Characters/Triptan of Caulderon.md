![[Triptan.jpg|500]]
Member of [[The Ramblers]]

Mother of [[Nyven of Caulderon]]

Former High Priestess of [[Equilus]] in the Temple of [[Village of Caulderon]]

Triptan spent many years as the High Priestess of [[Village of Caulderon]], watching over the temple to Equilus. Her daughter [[Nyven of Caulderon]]  grew up in the relative safety of Caulderon, until that safety was pierced by the Fiend. The Fiend first took Lazuli, Nyven’s childhood friend. Through Lazuli’s influence, Nyven soon had bound herself to the Fiend.   

After Nyven’s disappearance, Triptan set out to find her daughter.

Triptan traveled with Riz's Ramblers for a short while, ultimately sacrificing herself to save Nyven and the rest of the party.
