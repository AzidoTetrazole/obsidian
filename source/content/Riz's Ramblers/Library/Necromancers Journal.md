This journal belonged to Ularan Mortus, a high priest of Myrkul (god of death). The journals entries reference plans for the downfall of the Sword Coast…
 
"… Myrkul commands that one of his greatest servants be returned to him. I am to find the remains of his servant in a lost barrow burial mound in the Sword Coast. His exact locations are unknown, but my lord has made his will clear. We will set out from Estagund aboard the black galleon to bring death and destruction to the Sword Coast."
 
"Two months have we searched for the barrow, and for two months we have failed. Forces native to the cities and peoples of the Sword Coast have slowed our search, and followers of the storm god have begun to harry our search parties as well. We will prevail, as we are as patient and inevitable as death itself."
 
"The spirit of the galleon Emberlost is becoming a problem. He yearns for his long lost homeland of Anauria, and his mind turns ever more to the lost kingdom. I fear that his obsession may doom our efforts in the area, unless I can find a way to control him."
 
*A different handwriting has noted next to this entry: "Roadhouse? Could bard win him over?"*
 
"I cannot help but question the need for this long-dead servant. The pitiful Leilon has fallen greatly from the height if its power, they certainly could not withstand the might of Myrkul's faithful. With Leilon's fall and the relic in hand, nothing could stand in the way of our designs for the Sword Coast, nor the entire world of Toril!"
 
"My lord is displeased with the slow progress of our mission, but we are so close! Through we are delayed every day by powerful winds and rain, and our explorations of the barrows have been unfruitful so far, we near his final resting place. Chardanseravitriol, the Ebondeath, and one of Myrkul's most powerful servants slumbers fitfully. Once again Faerun will tremble under the shadow of his great black wings!"
